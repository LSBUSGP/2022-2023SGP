My project (1) contains 2 brief responses: FPS counter // Rolling road
My project (3) contains 1 brief response: Speedometer

In project (1), 'rolling road' Scene is the rolling road, 'Fps counter' scene is the fps counter

In project (3), search for 'MainsScene', this is where the speedometer will work in and the doc is located in the same space. In a separate
file called 'speedometer assets' or something similar, the speedometer script is located.

I didn't rename or move many things after I was done because I was afraid of losing my work (i lost some already due to being unable
to undo delete in Unity)
